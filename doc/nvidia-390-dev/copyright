First a note from the README file

Q: Why does NVIDIA not provide rpms anymore?

A: Not every Linux distribution uses rpm, and NVIDIA wanted a single
   solution that would work across all Linux distributions.  As indicated
   in the NVIDIA Software License, Linux distributions are welcome to
   repackage and redistribute the NVIDIA Linux driver in whatever package
   format they wish.

Furthermore, an email from NVIDIA:

This is fine; thanks for asking.

This is also fine.  I believe this section of the license was
intended to prevent users from doing things like using our Windows
control panel with a competitor's display driver (that's not actually
possible, but you get the idea...).  In the case of separating the
driver into a glx package and a kernel package (like we used to
do ourselves), this is simply a packaging issue; of course users
will use the packages together when they install.

Please feel free to redistribute the NVIDIA graphics driver.

Thank you for doing this for the NVIDIA+Debian community!

           License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software


IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of
the software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA")

RECITALS

Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
hardware on a graphics controller board, and a personal computer. The
SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright
treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.
The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use,
strictly in accordance with this document.  The hardware is protected
by various patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not cover
that sale, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package with
the SOFTWARE.  This agreement sets forth the terms and conditions
of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.

downloads the SOFTWARE.

2.  GRANT OF LICENSE

the following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:

2.1.1  Rights.  Customer may install and use one copy of the SOFTWARE
on a single computer, and except for making one back-up copy of
the Software, may not otherwise copy the SOFTWARE.  This LICENSE
of SOFTWARE may not be shared or used concurrently on different
computers.

2.1.2  Linux Exception.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of
Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux
operating system may be copied and redistributed, provided that
the binary files thereof are not modified in any way (except for
unzipping of compressed files).

2.1.3  Limitations.

No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer,
decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other
manner to obtain the source code.

No Separation of Components.  The SOFTWARE is licensed as a
single product.  Its component parts may not be separated for use
on more than one computer, nor otherwise used separately from the
other parts.

No Rental.  Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone
else.

3.  TERMINATION

This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to
comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof.  In such event,
Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its
component parts.

4.  COPYRIGHT

All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but
not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio,
music, text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE),
the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE,
are owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers.  The SOFTWARE is protected
by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Accordingly,
Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted
material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE
and that it may make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or
archive purposes.

5.  APPLICABLE LAW

This agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of California.

OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS

7.  MISCELLANEOUS 

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.  If any provision of this
LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under,
the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent
necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law.
This agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes
all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating
to such subject matter, whether oral or written.  Customer agrees
that it will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
